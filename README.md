# MyGitRepository
### Student Utility Toolkit

## Description
This repository was created as part for the **GitHub Collaboration** assignment in the course **COMP1243** for **Professor Lydia Bouzar-Benlabiod.**

This is a simple command-line based application developed to help students perform academic-grade related calculations.

This project demonstrates collaborative coding using GitHub by dividing it into multiple files across the team and managing contributions using version control.

## Problem Statement
Students often need quick tools to figure out their tentative grade in a course. Instead of manually figuring it out, this project aims to make the process simpler by having the user input the weightage and their acquired/assumed grade for each component.

## Technologies Used
+ Python
+ GitHub

## Team Members and Roles
+ Kayla Mombourquette - Calculator Module
+ Ninuri Siriwardena - Grade Analyzer Module
+ Melita Pereira - Main Program and Documentation

Each member worked on a separate branch and contributed through commits and pull requests.
